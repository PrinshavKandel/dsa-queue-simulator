This project (dsa-queue-simulator) contains a real time traffic simulation and management using the Queue and Priority Queue data structure to manage a 4 road intersection system. This project is built with the pygame module and interconnected through python socket programming. The main features of this program include; a queue based system that utilized the first in first out property to manage veichles and a priority condition, real life visualisation through pygame and communication through a client(simulator.py)-server(traffic_generator.py) socket system.

IMPORTANT:
Running the program is achieved by running the programs, traffic_generator.py and simulator.py simultaniously. One way to do that would be by running the command : "python traffic_generator.py & python simulator.py" in git-bash.
